# LectureSquat
is a tool for curious minds to get the most of Queen's University's broad academic offerings. Lectures are a rich resource and they deserve to utilized! Sit in on a lecture to expose yourself to new subjects or simply as a focused work enviroment. However, please keep in mind the fact that you are a guest and do not disrupt class or take up space that belongs to those enrolled in the course.

LectureSquat was built using a postgREST interface to course information scraped by the lovely people behind qcumber.ca. This tool is not in any way officially affiliated with Queenâ€™s University. 

The day of week is inferred automatically, and defaults to Monday on the weekends.
